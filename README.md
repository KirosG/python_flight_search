Python Flight Search
=========================

A simple and extendable series of Python scripts for searching flight options. Contributions welcome!

Scripts
--------

 * `qpx_express.py` - A script with some simple API, request and response classes for interacting with Google's [QPX Express API](https://developers.google.com/qpx-express/). For more documentation on the format of the request and response, see [the API Reference](https://developers.google.com/qpx-express/v1/).

Requirements
------------

Install the necessary requirements using the `requirements.txt` file. Not all scripts need all requirements, so please check the script you are interested in using if you'd like to individually install and use the packages.
